            After Omero wrapped up his firsting ventures, he had an entire second act to his life as a national shuffleboard champion.  (<i>Observer</i> 1976)

            "Much like with the firsts, he latched onto a hobby and turned it into more of a vocation. Or really more like a full-time occupation," said Lyman.

            Omero believed shuffleboarding to be a great mode of relaxation, even having therapeutic powers. He wrote a book on shuffleboarding and personally delivered copies of it to many libraries both across the U.S. and around the world.To this day, one of Robert Lyman's prized possessions is the signed copy of the self-published book that Omero sent him.

            "There's no question that he was a bit of an obsessive," explained Lyman. "Aside from becoming Mr. First and a diehard shuffleboarder, Omero also had huge collections of things like rocks and four-leaf clovers."
